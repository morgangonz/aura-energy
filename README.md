What color is your aura today? 
My app will tell you. 

This is a mobile phone application made using ionic. (with angular).

There are two main features. One is the learn more buttton on the home page to learn about auras, their meaning and how you measure them. 
the other is the quiz which accurately pops up what color aura you would be based off of your quiz answer. 

This application is not yet deployed on a phone, but if it were, you would be prompted to take a photo of yourself and then your specific color as defined by the quiz would appear as a border or glow around the image. 

I made calls to a google api facial recgoniation but due to not being able to upload a photo since it is still on the computer took those out. 

The photos and answers of colors are to be stored into a DB.

Under the learn more menu, there will be a gallery tab to view existing photos of other's showing their aura.

More to come.
