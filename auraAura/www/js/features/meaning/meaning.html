      <p style="color:#000000;">The aura has long been described as an electromagnetic energy field that surrounds people—like an egg-shaped ball of energy that encompasses the body. The aura consists of seven levels/layers/auric bodies, also known as the physical, astral, lower,
        higher, spiritual, intuitional, and absolute planes.</p>
